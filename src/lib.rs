//! # `findshlibs`
//!
//! Find the set of shared libraries currently loaded in this process with a
//! cross platform API.
//!
//! The API entry point is the `TargetSharedLibrary` type and its
//! `SharedLibrary::each` trait method implementation.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! Here is an example program that prints out each shared library that is
//! loaded in the process and the addresses where each of its segments are
//! mapped into memory.
//!
//! ```
//! extern crate findshlibs;
//! use findshlibs::{Segment, SharedLibrary, TargetSharedLibrary};
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     TargetSharedLibrary::each(|shlib| {
//!         println!("{}", shlib.name().to_string_lossy());
//!
//!         for seg in shlib.segments() {
//!             println!("    {}: segment {}",
//!                      seg.actual_virtual_memory_address(shlib),
//!                      seg.name());
//!         }
//!     });
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Supported OSes
//!
//! These are the OSes that `findshlibs` currently supports:
//!
//! * Linux
//! * macOS
//! * Windows
//! * Android
//! * iOS
//!
//! If a platform is not supported then a fallback implementation is used that
//! does nothing.  To see if your platform does something at runtime the
//! `TARGET_SUPPORTED` constant can be used.
//!
//! Is your OS missing here? Send us a pull request!
//!
//! ## Addresses
//!
//! Shared libraries' addresses can be confusing. They are loaded somewhere in
//! physical memory, but we generally don't care about physical memory
//! addresses, because only the OS can see that address and in userspace we can
//! only access memory through its virtual memory address. But even "virtual
//! memory address" is ambiguous because it isn't clear whether this is the
//! address before or after the loader maps the shared library into memory and
//! performs relocation.
//!
//! To clarify between these different kinds of addresses, we borrow some
//! terminology from [LUL][]:
//!
//! > * **SVMA** ("Stated Virtual Memory Address"): this is an address of a
//! >   symbol (etc) as it is stated in the symbol table, or other
//! >   metadata, of an object.  Such values are typically small and
//! >   start from zero or thereabouts, unless the object has been
//! >   prelinked.
//! >
//! > * **AVMA** ("Actual Virtual Memory Address"): this is the address of a
//! >   symbol (etc) in a running process, that is, once the associated
//! >   object has been mapped into a process.  Such values are typically
//! >   much larger than SVMAs, since objects can get mapped arbitrarily
//! >   far along the address space.
//! >
//! > * **"Bias"**: the difference between AVMA and SVMA for a given symbol
//! >   (specifically, AVMA - SVMA).  The bias is always an integral
//! >   number of pages.  Once we know the bias for a given object's
//! >   text section (for example), we can compute the AVMAs of all of
//! >   its text symbols by adding the bias to their SVMAs.
//!
//! [LUL]: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/13148faaa91a1c823a7d68563d9995480e714979/tools/profiler/lul/LulMain.h#17-51
//!
//! ## Names and IDs
//!
//! `findshlibs` also gives access to module names and IDs.  Since this is also
//! not consistent across operating systems the following general rules apply:
//!
//! > * `id` refers to the ID of the object file itself.  This is generally
//! >   available on all platforms however it might still not be compiled into
//! >   the binary in all case.  For instance on Linux the `gnu.build-id` note
//! >   needs to be compiled in (which Rust does automatically).
//! > * `debug_id` refers to the ID of the debug file.  This only plays a role
//! >   on Windows where the executable and the debug file (PDB) have a different
//! >   ID.
//! > * `name` is the name of the executable.  On most operating systems (and
//! >   all systems implemented currently) this is not just the name but in fact
//! >   the entire path to the executable.
//! > * `debug_name` is the name of the debug file if known.  This is again
//! >   the case on windows where this will be the path to the PDB file.
