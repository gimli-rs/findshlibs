//! # `findshlibs`
//!
//! Find the set of shared libraries (and current executable) currently mapped
//! into this process with a cross platform API.
//!
//! The API entry point is the `TargetSharedLibrary` type and its
//! `SharedLibrary::each` trait method implementation.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! Here is an example program that prints out each shared library that is
//! loaded in the process, and the addresses where each of its segments are
//! mapped into memory.
//!
//! ```
//! extern crate findshlibs;
//! use findshlibs::{NamedMemoryRange, SharedLibrary, TargetSharedLibrary};
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     TargetSharedLibrary::each(|shlib| {
//!         println!("{}", shlib.name().to_string_lossy());
//!
//!         for segment in shlib.segments() {
//!             println!(
//!                 "    {}: segment {}",
//!                 segment.actual_virtual_memory_address(shlib),
//!                 segment.name().to_string_lossy()
//!             );
//!         }
//!     });
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Here is an example program that finds the addresses where the `.eh_frame_hdr`
//! exception handling sections are mapped into memory:
//!
//! ```
//! extern crate findshlibs;
//! use findshlibs::{NamedMemoryRange, SharedLibrary, TargetSharedLibrary};
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     TargetSharedLibrary::each(|shlib| {
//!         println!("{}", shlib.name().to_string_lossy());
//!
//!         if let Some(eh_frame_hdr) = shlib.eh_frame_hdr() {
//!             println!(
//!                 "    .eh_frame_hdr @ {}",
//!                 eh_frame_hdr.actual_virtual_memory_address(shlib),
//!             );
//!         } else {
//!             println!("    (no .eh_frame_hdr)");
//!         }
//!     });
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Supported OSes
//!
//! These are the OSes that `findshlibs` currently supports:
//!
//! * Linux
//! * macOS
//!
//! If a platform is not supported then a fallback implementation is used that
//! does nothing.  To see if your platform does something at runtime the
//! `TARGET_SUPPORTED` constant can be used.
//!
//! Is your OS missing here? Send us a pull request!
//!
//! ## Addresses
//!
//! Shared libraries' addresses can be confusing. They are loaded somewhere in
//! physical memory, but we generally don't care about physical memory
//! addresses, because only the OS can see that address and in userspace we can
//! only access memory through its virtual memory address. But even "virtual
//! memory address" is ambiguous because it isn't clear whether this is the
//! address before or after the loader maps the shared library into memory and
//! performs relocation.
//!
//! To clarify between these different kinds of addresses, we borrow some
//! terminology from [LUL][]:
//!
//! > * **SVMA** ("Stated Virtual Memory Address"): this is an address of a
//! >   symbol (etc) as it is stated in the symbol table, or other
//! >   metadata, of an object.  Such values are typically small and
//! >   start from zero or thereabouts, unless the object has been
//! >   prelinked.
//! >
//! > * **AVMA** ("Actual Virtual Memory Address"): this is the address of a
//! >   symbol (etc) in a running process, that is, once the associated
//! >   object has been mapped into a process.  Such values are typically
//! >   much larger than SVMAs, since objects can get mapped arbitrarily
//! >   far along the address space.
//! >
//! > * **"Bias"**: the difference between AVMA and SVMA for a given symbol
//! >   (specifically, AVMA - SVMA).  The bias is always an integral
//! >   number of pages.  Once we know the bias for a given object's
//! >   text section (for example), we can compute the AVMAs of all of
//! >   its text symbols by adding the bias to their SVMAs.
//!
